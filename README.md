# Expo-mobile-app
- The app uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) features.
- [JokeApi](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any) is used to fetch random jokes when clicked on the button which is in Drawer-navigator.
- Native stack-navigator makes a stack of current open pages.
- It then makes a new stacked page on top of the root tab, which helps to navigate through all the pages easily.
- The bottom navigator has two menus and the Drawer navigator also has two options.
